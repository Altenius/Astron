Building with _Visual Studio_ on Windows
------------------------------------------

### Dependencies ###
You will need to, of-course, clone the repository.
After you have the repository you will need to download and build Astron's
dependencies.  See the [building readme](https://github.com/Astron/Astron/blob/build-instructions/doc/building/readme.md) for instructions.


### Preparing the VS Project ###
_Preparing Astron for VisualStudio requires CMake. It is recommend to use the
cmake-gui. (Download from http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html)_

Under `Where is the source code:` Enter the path to your clone of Astron, then
hit the `Configure` button.

For `Where to build the binaries:` it is recommended to use a directory outside
of the repository such as `<ASTRON_PATH>/../build` or one for each release type
`../Debug/`, `../RelWithDebInfo`, and `../Release`.

 - To build Astron for release, set the value named `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` to `Release`.
 - For developing with Trace and Debug messages, set it to `Debug`.
 - For development without extra messages (RelWithDebInfo), leave it blank.

Finally, hit the `Generate` button.


 ### Compiling ###
Using Visual Studio, open the solution generated by CMake at wherever you set your
build path.  You should then be able to build the solution with VS.  By default,
the keyboard shortcut for building the solution is the `F7` key.
